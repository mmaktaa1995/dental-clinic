description: Review project information and code to produce a concise summary
---

Look at `/projectInformation.md` first and then search through the codebase for relevant files that use similar concepts. Once you feel like you've understood what the user is asking, output a very short 1-2 sentence summary of what you found and you're done. Do not implement anything yet.
