# Dental Clinic Automation - Enhancement Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the plan to enhance the security of the dental clinic automation system and implement comprehensive API testing. The goal is to ensure the application is secure, reliable, and maintainable.

## Security Enhancements

- [x] Add email verification for new user accounts
  - Implemented email verification with custom notification
  - Added protected routes for verified users only
  - Created comprehensive tests for all verification scenarios
- [x] Implement password complexity requirements
  - Added validation rules for password complexity (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
  - Added custom error message for password requirements
  - Created tests to verify password complexity validation
- [x] Add account lockout after failed login attempts

  - Updated `UploadFilesController` to use the request validation and improve security
  - Added detailed logging for file upload activities and potential security threats
  - Implemented proper error handling for file uploads

### 3. Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest (patient records, payment info) // Fo later
- [x] Implement proper logging of sensitive operations
  - Created a dedicated `sensitive_operations` log channel with 90-day retention
  - Implemented `SensitiveOperationsLogger` service for centralized logging
  - Added comprehensive logging in `UsersController`, `RolesController`, and `LoginController`
  - Logged all sensitive operations (create, update, delete, login, logout) with detailed context
  - Created unit tests to verify logging functionality
- [x] Add data backup and recovery procedures
- [x] Implement audit logging for critical operations

### 4. API Security
